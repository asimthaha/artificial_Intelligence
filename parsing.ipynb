It is the third entry in the Kingdom series. Players control a mounted monarch as they attempt to defend their kingdom from a race of monsters. The monarch can build defenses to fend off night attacks and recruit villagers to perform certain jobs. The game features single-player and cooperative multiplayer modes, with the latter allowing two people to play together via a split screen. The developers originally designed Kingdom Two Crowns as an expansion pack for Kingdom: New Lands (2016). As the expansion grew, they decided to release it as a separate game. Kingdom Two Crowns was released for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One on December 11, 2018, and for iOS and Android on April 28, 2020. It received positive reviews, gaining praise for its strategic gameplay, artwork, and cooperative multiplayer mode, though its slow pace was criticized.\"\n","\n","doc=nlp(text)\n","for sent in doc.sents:\n","  print(\">\", sent)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2eMKWomviWey","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1691555428335,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":513,"user":{"displayName":"22PMC118 Asim Thaha Azeez","userId":"12011618729708686280"}},"outputId":"221bf7b3-e677-4b6e-92bf-331ca3a58931"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["> Kingdom Two Crowns is a 2018 strategy video game developed by Thomas van den Berg and Coatsink and published by Raw Fury.\n","> It is the third entry in the Kingdom series.\n","> Players control a mounted monarch as they attempt to defend their kingdom from a race of monsters.\n","> The monarch can build defenses to fend off night attacks and recruit villagers to perform certain jobs.\n","> The game features single-player and cooperative multiplayer modes, with the latter allowing two people to play together via a split screen.\n","> The developers originally designed Kingdom Two Crowns as an expansion pack for Kingdom: New Lands (2016).\n","> As the expansion grew, they decided to release it as a separate game.\n","> Kingdom Two Crowns was released for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One on December 11, 2018, and for iOS and Android on April 28, 2020.\n","> It received positive reviews, gaining praise for its strategic gameplay, artwork, and cooperative multiplayer mode, though its slow pace was criticized.\n"]}]}]}
